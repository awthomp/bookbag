# bookbag
A collection of notebooks designed to document things I find helpful or interesting. Mostly about GPUs.

# List of Notebooks
1. [gpu_interop_dlframeworks](https://github.com/awthomp/bookbag/blob/master/notebooks/interoperability/gpu_interop_dlframeworks.ipynb)

    Demonstrating passing data between frameworks adopting the `__cuda_array_interface__` like [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy), and [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) and between these frameworks and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) via [DLPack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack) with [tfdlpack](https://github.com/VoVAllen/tf-dlpack).
